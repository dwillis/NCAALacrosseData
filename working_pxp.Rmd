## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)

```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

library(lubridate)

```{r}

```{r}
# read in the html and extract all the tables
pxp_script <- sample_pxp_url %>%
  read_html() %>%
  html_table()

# show the dataframe

resultsq1 <- pxp_script[[6]]
resultsq2 <- pxp_script[[8]]
resultsq3 <- pxp_script[[10]]
resultsq4 <- pxp_script[[12]]

resultsq1

```

```{r}
## Clean q1 results to slice top row, add in quarter number

first_quarter <- resultsq1 %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate("Quarter" = "1")

```

```{r}
## Clean q2 results to slice top row, add in quarter number

second_quarter <- resultsq2 %>% 
  slice(-1) %>% 
  mutate("Quarter" = "2")

```

```{r}

```

```{r}

## Combine quarters to return whole rows. Learn how to use paste function for the team names

whole_game <- bind_rows(list(first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, fourth_quarter)) %>% 
  rename("Time in Quarter" = X1, "Cornell" = X2, "Score" = X3, "Hobart" = X4)

```
